Book Entity API

This project implements a REST API for managing books, built with GoLang, as per the requirements of the Software Engineering Intern Technical Assignment. The application uses a text file (JSON format) as the data persistence layer and includes CRUD operations, a keyword search endpoint, and performance optimization using Go's concurrency primitives. Bonus tasks, such as Docker containerization and unit tests, are also included.
